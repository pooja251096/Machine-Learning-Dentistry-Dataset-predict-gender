# Machine-Learning-Dentistry-Dataset-predict-gender

## Project Title :- Using Dental Metrics to Predict Gender.

## Project Objective :-
The goal of this project is to analyse the data and predict, based on a combination of dental features that describes the Gender of the person.

## Methodology :-
## Project Thoughts :-
step 1.) Data Collection:

Gather a dataset comprising various dental metrics from a diverse sample population.

Ensure the dataset includes labeled gender information for supervised learning.

step 2.) Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, if any, through imputation or removal.

Normalize or standardize the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

step 3.) Feature Engineering:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of the dental metrics.
step 4.) Model Training and building

In this step i do train-test split, first i split the data into 2 parts, one is called trained and another one is test.

then i go for model building and fit the data according to model. So, various models will be tested, including LogisticRegression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and XGBOOST classifier.

# Conclusion :-
By leveraging dental metrics and advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide a reliable method for predicting gender. The use of LogisticRegression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random forest Classifier and XGBoost ensures that the model is not only accurate but also efficient, making it a valuable tool in forensic and anthropological studies.
